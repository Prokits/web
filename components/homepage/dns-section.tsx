                    Your ISP can see every site and app you use, even if they&apos;re encrypted. Some providers even sell this data, or use it to target you with ads.

                    Prokits DNS prevents anyone from snooping on you by encrypting more of the traffic leaving your device. We believe privacy is a right. We won&apos;t sell your data, ever.
